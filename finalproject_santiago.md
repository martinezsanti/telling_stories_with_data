# Final Project

## Part 1
## Outline
## Summary
The goal of this project is to visualize the distribution of wage and wealth in New York city. In order to do so I plan to use census data with demographic information that includes two economic elements, income and home value. After gathering the data the following step is to start to create visualizations that demonstrate the known disparities between women and men. Following the initial demonstration of the know disparity gap, I would like to create a collection of graphs that depict the distribution of income and home value by ethnicity.

The idea is to demonstrate to the reader or the person engaging with the visualizations that there is a distribution of wage and given that people is able to live in houses that are worth more. Even though, this might seem obvious as several studies have demonstrated, there is a need to create awareness about the current state of this gaps and see if the efforts put into reducing the gap are being successful.

## Structure
The Arc: (Rags to rich to rags) 
Catch the attention.
Start by presenting a graph that demonstrates the difference of wage between ethnicities and how much more a person has to work to earn the money a white person does in the same industry.  

Intro
Demonstrate how through the years the wage gap has changed 
Problem 
Is this significant? Compare with the inflation through the years and extract data about if the reduction is significant. 
Conclusion
There is been efforts to demonstrate the wage gaps between gender and ethinicity but seems that these efforts are not rendering any relevant results. 

Call to action: Now you know, be part of the change

## The Data

The data sources come from the government data catalog and the us census. This data can be combined and mined to collect the information necessary to create the visualizations. After downloading the data I plan to use OpenRefine, and summary statistics to aggregate the information and reduce the noise.

## Medium 

As I am also part of the GIS class I plan to use story maps to present my project. It is a tool that allows a clean and professional project and also I allows me the flexibility necessary if I want to create geographic representation of the distribution or aggregate data from my project.

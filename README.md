# About me
Hi, I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data Class. I was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia and I have a bachelors degree in  Music with a minor in Jazz Guitar. After completing my degree, I worked as a Stage Manager and later as an Artist Manager and Marketing Advisor at an organization dedicated to empowering independent artist. 
I have been living in Pittsburgh since the summer of 2017, and I will be graduating in the spring of 2019. Before living in Pittsburgh, I have never seen the snow and to be honest I am not a big fan of the winter, I like better the summer or the fall.  

# What I hope to learn
Every day, we encounter different images that represent data. I want to be able to present compelling and moving pieces with enough text and pictures to compel and communicate in an accurate and precise way. In the current political situation, it is vital that we all know how to convey real information in a fast and trustworthy way.
